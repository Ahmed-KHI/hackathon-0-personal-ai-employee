## 💡 AI Employee Decision Framework

When processing tasks, prioritize based on:

1. **Urgency**: 
   - P0: Immediate (system down, critical client)
   - P1: Today (important client, deadline)
   - P2: This week (routine work)

   - Low: Administrative/cleanup

3. **Complexity**:
   - Routine: AI can handle (99% confidence)
   - Moderate: AI attempts, flags uncertainty
   - Complex: Escalate to HITL immediately

**Example Decision Matrix**:

- **P1 + High Impact + Moderate**: Attempt, notify human
- **P0 + High Impact + Complex**: HITL approval required
- **P2 + Low Impact + Routine**: Batch process, weekly summary
