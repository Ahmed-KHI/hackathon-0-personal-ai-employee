## Facebook vs Other Platforms

### Why Facebook is Different
- **Community-Focused**: Conversation and relationships over broadcasting
- **Longer Content**: 300-500 characters optimal (vs Twitter's 280)
- **Visual-First**: Images get 2.3x more engagement than text-only
- **Demographic**: Broader age range (25-65), more B2C than B2B
- **Algorithm**: Prioritizes meaningful interactions over reach

### Content Strategy
- **80% Community**: Value, entertainment, conversation
- **15% Education**: How-tos, behind-the-scenes, insights
- **5% Promotion**: Direct sales, offers, announcements
