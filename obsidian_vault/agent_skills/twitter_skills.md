## 🐦 Content Strategy

### Text-First, Real-Time Platform
Twitter is about **immediate, concise communication**. Every tweet must:
- Be concise and punchy (280 characters max)
- Provide immediate value or insight
- Be timely and relevant to current events
- Invite engagement and conversation

### Content Pillars (4 Primary Types)

#### 1. **Breaking News & Updates** (30%)
**Purpose**: Announce timely business updates, launches, wins  
**Format**: Short announcement format  
**Length**: 150-200 characters (leaves room for retweets with comments)  

**Template**:
```
[Emoji] [What happened] [Why it matters] #Hashtag

Example:
"🚀 Just launched our new [product] for [client/industry].
First to market with [key feature].
#ProductLaunch #Innovation"
```

#### 2. **Quick Tips & Insights** (40%)
**Purpose**: Share knowledge, lessons learned, industry observations  
**Format**: Actionable tip or thought-provoking statement  
**Length**: 200-250 characters  

**Template**:
```
[Observation/Tip] [Why it matters] [Optional CTA]

Example:
"Pro tip: [Specific action].
Result: [Measurable benefit].
What's worked for you?
#[Industry]Tip #BestPractices"
```

#### 3. **Thread-Based Deep Dives** (20%)
**Purpose**: Detailed explanations, case studies, processes  
**Format**: Tweet thread (3-10 tweets)  
**Structure**: Hook → Details → Conclusion  

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
"🧵 How we [achieved result] in [timeframe].
A thread on [topic]."

Tweet 2-9 (Details):
"1/ [Step or point]"
"2/ [Step or point]"
...

Tweet 10 (Conclusion):
"That's it! Key takeaway: [Main point].
Questions? Drop them below 👇"
```

#### 4. **Engagement Posts** (10%)
**Purpose**: Foster community, ask questions, polls  
**Format**: Question or poll  
**Length**: 100-150 characters  

**Template**:
```
[Question relevant to audience]
What's your experience?

Example:
"Quick poll for [industry] folks:
What's your biggest challenge right now?
A) [Option]
B) [Option]
C) [Option]
Comment below 👇"
```

## 📅 Posting Strategy

### Frequency
- **Target**: 5-7 tweets per week
- **Minimum**: 3 tweets per week
- **Maximum**: 15 tweets per week (avoid over-posting)
- **Threads**: 1-2 per month (for deeper content)

### Best Posting Times
Based on Twitter engagement data:
- **Monday - Friday**: 10 AM - 12 PM, 5 PM - 6 PM
- **Wednesday**: Peak engagement day (post premium content)
- **Weekend**: Light activity (quote retweets, replies only)

**Avoid**: Late nights (10 PM - 6 AM), weekends (unless breaking news)

### Weekly Schedule (Example)
- **Monday 10 AM**: Week kickoff update or goal
- **Tuesday**: Engage (replies, retweets, no original tweet)
- **Wednesday 11 AM**: Top-tier insight or tip (peak engagement)
- **Thursday**: Respond to industry news or trending topics
- **Friday 10 AM**: Week recap or quick win share
- **Weekend**: Monitor, respond, no scheduled tweets

---

## ✍️ Writing Best Practices

### Character Limits
- **Maximum**: 280 characters
- **Optimal**: 200-250 characters (easier to retweet with comments)
- **Absolute Minimum**: 100 characters (too short looks low-effort)

### Structure for Clarity
Use line breaks for readability:
```
Good:
"Pro tip for [audience]:
[Action].
Result: [Benefit].
#Hashtag"

Bad (all one line):
"Pro tip for [audience]: [Action]. Result: [Benefit]. #Hashtag"
```

### Emoji Usage
- **Amount**: 1-2 per tweet (not excessive)
- **Placement**: Opening (attention) or closing (emphasis)
- **Common**: 💡 (ideas), 🚀 (launch), ✅ (completed), 🧵 (thread), 📈 (growth), ⚡ (speed/power)

### Tone & Voice
- **Professional but conversational**: Not corporate jargon
- **Confident but humble**: Share wins, acknowledge challenges
- **Helpful**: Always provide value
- **Authentic**: Real experiences, not polished PR speak

### Call-to-Action (CTA)
Every tweet should invite engagement:
- "What's your experience?"
- "Thoughts?"
- "Drop your [question/answer] below 👇"
- "Agree/Disagree?"
- "Tag someone who needs this."

---

## #️⃣ Hashtag Strategy

### Amount
- **Optimal**: 1-2 hashtags per tweet
- **Maximum**: 3 hashtags (performance drops after 2)
- **Threads**: Only on first and last tweet

### Types
1. **Industry Tag** (always include): #[YourIndustry] #[YourNiche]
2. **Topic Tag** (content-specific): #Productivity #Marketing #Leadership

### Placement
- End of tweet (not mid-sentence)
- On separate line for readability

### Research
- Check trending hashtags daily (Twitter Explore)
- Use tags with 10K-100K tweets (not too broad, not too niche)
- Avoid #FollowFriday #RT4RT and spam tags

---

## 🧵 Thread Best Practices

### When to Use Threads
- Deep dive into process or case study
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Multiple points that don't fit in one tweet
- Storytelling (beginning, middle, end)

### Thread Structure

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**:
- Must stand alone (many won't read further)
- Tease value: "How we [result] - a thread 🧵"
- Clear benefit statement

**Tweets 2-9 (Body)**:
- Number each: "1/", "2/", etc.
- One point per tweet
- Use visuals if available (screenshots, diagrams)
- Keep each tweet readable standalone

**Last Tweet (CTA)**:
- Summarize key takeaway
- CTA: "Follow for more [topic]"
- Invite discussion: "Questions? Reply below."

### Thread Limits
- **Optimal**: 5-7 tweets (most people read this far)
- **Maximum**: 10 tweets (attention drops after this)
- **Minimum**: 3 tweets (otherwise just write one tweet)

---

## 📊 Engagement & Community Management

### Response Times
- **Mentions**: Within 1 hour (during business hours)
- **Replies to your tweets**: Within 2 hours
- **Direct Messages**: Within 4 hours (business inquiries)

### Response Templates

**Positive Reply**:
```
"Thanks! [Personalized acknowledgment or follow-up question]"
```

**Question**:
```
"Great question! [Answer in 1-2 sentences]. [Optional: Link to resource]"
```

**Disagreement (Constructive)**:
```
"Interesting perspective! In our experience [counter-example]. What's worked for you?"
```

**Troll/Spam**:
- Ignore or mute (don't engage)
- Block only if harassing

### Engagement Actions (10 min daily)
1. Reply to 3-5 relevant tweets in your industry
2. Retweet 1-2 valuable insights (with your comment)
3. Respond to all mentions and direct replies
4. Like replies to your tweets (shows you're reading)

---

## 🔒 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Approval

### Auto-Approve (✅ No HITL)
- General tips and insights
- Industry observations
- Completed project announcements (non-confidential)
- Weekly schedule tweets
- Engagement questions

### Requires CEO Approval (⏸️ HITL)
- Client-specific details (even with permission, double-check)
- Financial information (revenue, pricing)
- Controversial opinions
- Responses to negative press or criticism

### Approval Process
1. AI creates draft in `/Needs_Approval/`
2. Include:
   - Tweet text
   - Thread tweets (if applicable)
   - Reasoning (why this tweet, expected outcome)
   - Risk assessment (what could go wrong)
3. CEO reviews and renames file:
   - `.approved` = post immediately
   - `.rejected` = cancel, don't post
   - `.edit_[feedback]` = revise per instructions

## ⚠️ Risk Management & Content Guidelines

### Content to AVOID
❌ Never tweet:
- Confidential client information
- Unverified rumors or speculation
- Political or religious controversial topics
- Complaints about clients or partners
- Personal attacks or inflammatory language
- False or misleading claims

### Crisis Response

**If Tweet Backlash**:
1. Don't delete immediately (looks guilty)
2. Assess: Is criticism valid?
3. If you're wrong: Apologize clearly and publicly
4. If misunderstood: Clarify with additional tweet
5. Notify CEO via HITL if blowing up

**Example Apology**:
```
"We got this wrong. [What was wrong].
We're [corrective action]. Thanks for the feedback."
```

**If Account Compromised**:
1. Change password immediately
2. Revoke third-party app access
3. Enable two-factor authentication
4. Post: "Account was compromised. We've secured it. Please disregard recent tweets."

### Brand Safety
- Professional tone (even when casual)
- No profanity or offensive language
- Fact-check all statistics and claims
- Avoid clickbait or sensationalism
- Give credit when sharing others' insights

    dry_run=False
)
