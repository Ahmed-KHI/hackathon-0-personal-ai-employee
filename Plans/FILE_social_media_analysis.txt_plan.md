# Plan for FILE_social_media_analysis.txt

I'll analyze this file drop task and create a detailed execution plan. Let me examine the situation and create the necessary files.

## Analysis

The file `social_media_analysis.txt` appears to be empty (0 bytes), which could indicate:
1. File upload failed or was corrupted
2. Placeholder file waiting for content
3. Template file that needs population

Since I cannot see the actual content, I'll create a comprehensive plan to handle this situation safely.

## Files to Create:
