## 📸 Content Strategy

### Visual-First Philosophy
Instagram is a **visual storytelling platform**. Every post must:
- Lead with a high-quality image or graphic
- Tell a story through visuals + caption
- Evoke emotional response or provide value
- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic

### Content Pillars (4 Primary Types)

#### 1. **Educational Posts** (40%)
**Purpose**: Share knowledge, tips, and insights  
**Format**: Infographics, carousel tutorials, process diagrams  
**Caption**: Start with hook, provide actionable tip, CTA to save/share  

**Example**:
```
Image: 5-step workflow infographic
Caption: "5 steps to [solve problem] ⚡

Step 1: [Action]
Step 2: [Action]
...

💾 Save this for later!
👉 Tag someone who needs this

#[IndustryTip] #[ProcessName] #HowTo #Tutorial"
```

#### 2. **Behind-the-Scenes** (30%)
**Purpose**: Humanize brand, show process, build authenticity  
**Format**: Workspace photos, tool screenshots, work-in-progress  
**Caption**: Conversational, relatable, show challenges overcome  

**Example**:
```
Image: Laptop setup with coffee, notes, tools
Caption: "Monday morning = planning mode ☕📋

This week we're working on [project]. 
Here's our process:
✓ [Step 1]
✓ [Step 2]
→ [Current step]

What does your workspace look like? Drop a 📸 below!

#WorkInProgress #BehindTheScenes #[Industry]"
```

#### 3. **Success Stories** (20%)
**Purpose**: Showcase results, build credibility, attract clients  
**Format**: Before/after, testimonials, milestone graphics  
**Caption**: Client-centric, outcome-focused, social proof  

**Example**:
```
Image: Client result graphic or before/after comparison
Caption: "From [problem] to [solution] in [timeframe] 🚀

Client: [Name/Industry]
Challenge: [What they faced]
Solution: [What we did]
Result: [Measurable outcome]

Want results like this? Link in bio 👆

#ClientSuccess #CaseStudy #[Industry]"
```

#### 4. **Personal/Culture** (10%)
**Purpose**: Show values, team, company personality  
**Format**: Team photos, office culture, personal reflections  
**Caption**: Authentic, values-driven, invites connection  

**Example**:
```
Image: Team celebrating or personal moment
Caption: "Small win = big celebration 🎉

Today we [milestone]. 
Grateful for the team that made it happen.

Here's to more wins ahead! 🙌

#TeamWin #SmallBusiness #Grateful"
```

## 🎨 Visual Content Guidelines

### Image Specs
- **Feed Posts**: 
  - Square (1:1): 1080 x 1080 pixels
  - Vertical (4:5): 1080 x 1350 pixels (recommended for visibility)
- **Stories**: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 ratio)

### Visual Quality
✅ **DO**:

### Brand Consistency
- **Color Palette**: [Brand primary, secondary colors]
- **Font**: [Brand font or Instagram-friendly sans-serif]
- **Logo**: Watermark in corner (subtle, not obtrusive)
- **Filters**: Use consistent preset (e.g., slight brightness, +10 contrast)

## ✍️ Caption Best Practices

### Structure
1. **Hook** (First 125 characters - visible before "more")
   - Ask question, state benefit, make bold claim
2. **Body** (Up to 2200 characters)
   - Tell story, provide value, explain context
3. **Call-to-Action**
   - Save, share, comment, tag, visit link in bio
4. **Hashtags** (End of caption or first comment)
   - 15-20 hashtags (mix of sizes)

### Writing Style
- **Conversational**: Write like talking to a friend
- **Authentic**: Show vulnerability, real challenges
- **Value-driven**: What's in it for the reader?
- **Scannable**: Use line breaks, emojis, bullet points

### Emojis
- Use 2-4 per caption to add visual interest
- Relevant to message (not random)
- Common choices: 💡🚀✨🎯💪📈⚡🔥✓

   - Example: #DigitalMarketing #BusinessTips #SmallBusinessOwner
3. **Niche Hashtags** (<50K posts): 5-7 tags
   - Example: #[YourIndustry]Tips #[YourCity]Business

### Industry-Specific Tags
- **Core Tags** (use every post): #[YourIndustry] #[YourNiche] #[YourLocation]
- **Content Tags** (match post type): #Tutorial #BehindTheScenes #CaseStudy

### Hashtag Limit
- **Maximum**: 30 hashtags per post
- **Optimal**: 15-20 hashtags (better engagement than 30)
- **Placement**: Either end of caption or first comment

### Research & Rotation

## 🛠️ Technical Integration

### MCP Server Actions
```python
# Post single photo
instagram_server.post_photo(
    image_url="https://example.com/image.jpg",
    caption="Caption text with #hashtags",
    dry_run=False
)

# Post carousel (2-10 images)
instagram_server.post_carousel(
    image_urls=["url1.jpg", "url2.jpg", "url3.jpg"],
    caption="Swipe for more →",
    dry_run=False
)

# Post to Stories
instagram_server.post_story(
    image_url="https://example.com/story.jpg",
    dry_run=False
)

# Get recent posts
instagram_server.get_media(limit=10)

# Get insights
instagram_server.get_insights()  # Account-level
instagram_server.get_insights(media_id="12345")  # Post-level
```

### Task Queue Integration
Instagram watcher creates tasks in `task_queue/inbox/` with:

- `trigger: "visual_content" | "milestone" | "behind_the_scenes" | "weekly_schedule"`
- `content`: Relevant context (item name, description, milestone text)
- `instructions`: AI guidance from `_get_instructions()`

Orchestrator claims task, follows instructions, executes MCP action, logs result.
