### 2. ⚠️ Landing Page / Dashboard Question

**Your Question**: "Should I create a Landing page or Dashboard to observe the working of this digital FTE?"

**Answer**: **NO, NOT REQUIRED** ❌

**Reasoning**:
1. **Hackathon.doc DOES NOT require a UI/dashboard**
2. **Obsidian Dashboard.md serves this purpose** (file-based dashboard)
3. **GKE API Server already exposes Dashboard.md** (http://34.136.6.152:8000)
4. **Adding a UI now risks introducing new bugs** before submission
5. **File-based monitoring is part of the architecture** (local-first design)

**What You Already Have**:
- ✅ **obsidian_vault/Dashboard.md** (real-time status)
- ✅ **GKE API Server** (serves Dashboard.md via HTTP)
- ✅ **Obsidian App** (visual vault interface)
- ✅ **PM2 Dashboard** (`pm2 monit` for process monitoring)
